# Customizing OrbitDB
In the first chapter of this Field Manual,
we described how you might create
a couple of built-in OrbitDB databases
and write code to modify it.

We shall try to build on this Tutorial
to show you, how you can customize
the built-in OrbitDB stores, access controllers
and indices or how you can define your own.

In order to do this, we will follow this agenda:

1. Defining the `Store`, `AccessController` and `Index`.
2. Creating custom Access Controllers.
3. Creating a custom store.
4. Creating a custom index.
