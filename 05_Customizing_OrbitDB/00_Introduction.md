# Customizing OrbitDB
In the first chapter of this Field Manual,
we described how you might create
a couple of built-in OrbitDB databases
and write code to modify it.

We shall try to build on this t0utorial
to show you, how you can customize
the built-in OrbitDB stores, access controllers
and indices or how you can define your own.

In order to do this, we will follow this agenda:

1. [Defining the `Store`, `AccessController` and `Index`.](01_Definitions.md)
2. [Creating custom Access Controllers.](02_AccessController.md)
3. [Creating a custom store.](03_Store.md)
4. [Creating a custom index.](04_Index.md)
