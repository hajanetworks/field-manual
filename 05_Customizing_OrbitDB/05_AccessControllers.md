# Moderating your Comment Threads.
We have now gotten a store, that
you can publish notes and comments with.

But you cannot actually
control, who and what
gets to comment and be a comment.

In other words: How can you moderate
a Peer-to-Peer Database?

Well, you can't really.
Or at least, you cannot
moderate data on another
persons computer.

I cannot delete a file on
your computer, anymore
than you can delete a file
on mine.

If either of us could do that,
we would consider that malware.

And this is not a Tutorial
on writing malware, so we'll not
go into it.

Moderating is generally considered
to be two separate tasks:
1. Restricting the writing to a database
2. Restricting the reading from a database and sharing of content.s

In a decentralized network, sharing data
is easy. Once any peer has some data, they
can share it essentially until their
bandwidth runs out.

But writing control is more complex.
We cannot prevent somebody from
writing to their own local
database, but we can decide,
whether we will accept the
local changes from another
peer in our own database.

And there OrbitDB `AccessController`s
come into action.
