## What's in the book?

The book opens with **[an introduction](./00_Introduction)** that gives an overview of the promises and risks of the distributed space, and describes OrbitDB and its use cases at a high level.

**[The tutorial](./01_Tutorial/00_Introduction.md)** begins by guiding you through building a JavaScript application from scratch. You will work through: installation and database creation; managing and structuring your data; networking, communicating, and sharing data in a peer-to-peer fashion; and finally managing distributed identity and access to the databases. By the end of the tutorial, you should have everything you need.

Next, **[Thinking Peer to Peer](./02_Thinking_Peer_to_Peer)** is a collection of essays that approach peer-to-peer engineering from a more intellectual and philosophical perspective. It is light on code and heavy on ideas. It is also open for community members to contribute essays of their own, pending editorial review.

Then, **[The Architecture of OrbitDB](./03_The_Architecture_of_OrbitDB)** covers in-depth, in a more reference style, the  structured and architecture of OrbitDB. It includes a description of `ipfs-log`, the core of OrbitDB, the data `stores` and finally how the `orbit-db` library brings it all together into a single, cohesive package that works both in the browser and on the command line.

**[What comes next?](./04_What_Next)** provides some guidance and suggestions about subsequent topics you should explore. This section serves as a launch pad to further your understanding of how our distributed future will be built.

And after all that, we have a chapter on
how you might write custom Stores in OrbitDB
in **[Customizing OrbitDB](./05_Customizing_OrbitDB/00_Introduction.md)**, written in the form
of a second Tutorial, that is based on our
first chapter.

## How to read this book

While this book is best consumed by reading cover-to-cover, we understand that your time is valuable and you want to get the most out of it in the shortest amount of time. Here are some suggestions to digest the information efficiently.

If you are a technical person and want to use OrbitDB to build distributed, peer-to-peer applications, start with [Part 1: The tutorial](./01_Tutorial/00_Introduction.md), move to [Part 3: The Architecture of OrbitDB](./03_The_Architecture_of_OrbitDB), and then read chapters from [Part 2](./02_Thinking_Peer_to_Peer) and [Part 4](./04_What_Next) as necessary to fill in any knowledge gaps you may have.

After reading Part 1, Part 3 and Part 2, you
are equipped to read [Part 5: Customizing OrbitDB](./05_Customizing_OrbitDB/00_Introduction.md).

If you do not want to write code, but instead want to understand peer-to-peer systems and architectures at a higher level, you should be able to get away with only reading [Part 2: Thinking Peer to Peer](./02_Thinking_Peer_to_Peer), and then moving on to [Part 4](./04_What_Next), followed by [Part 3](./03_The_Architecture_of_OrbitDB).

Please note that we may repeat ourselves in different parts of the book. This is intentional because we cannot guarantee people will read the sections of the book in order. Please skim any sections that you already feel like you understand.

## Getting the book

## Gaps and out-of-date sections

OrbitDB is an alpha phase software in an
alpha industry.
A risk of this fact is, that
documentation can quickly become
out-of-date and be filled with errors.

It is thus vital, that everyone reading
the Field Manual from OrbitDB also
stay in contact with the OrbitDB Community
on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!HsJJxyITRbsZekFjiE:gitter.im?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org&via=familymoyaers.com) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/orbitdb/Lobby) for questions and reporting of issues
with the Manual.
